# Initial drafty draft charter-like text for an IAB program on resilience

## Naming bikeshed

A couple of possibilities:

- CHallenges for Internet Resilience Program (chirp)
- IAB Resilient Internet Program (iab-rip)

## Charter text

[Definition of resilience](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/resilience):

1. the capability of a strained body to recover its size and shape after
   deformation caused especially by compressive stress
2. an ability to recover from or adjust easily to misfortune or change

We're mostly interested in sense#2.

Resilience is a desirable feature for Internet technologies and the deployed
Internet.  Many IETF technologies have been designed with
resiliency as a core feature, often through a distributed architecture
(e.g. BGP, DNS, SMTP). However, there can be cases where implementations or deployments of
IETF-defined protocols create challenges to Internet resilience.  For example,
if one implementation dominates to the extent that bugs or vulnerabilities in
that implementation could create significant effects, or if a small number of
service providers are so widely used as to make them effectively too large to
fail, even though failures are always possible. The <name> program provides a
venue where these issues can be analysed.

The program aims to complement, but not overlap with, work that is in scope for
IETF working groups for example, opsawg and dnsop. If such overlaps are
identified then it is preferred that work be done within the relevant IETF
working groups, should they want to undertake that work.

A small number of longer-term program members are appointed by the IAB, other
individuals will be invited to participate on specific topics based on their
expertise without needing to provide a long-term committment.

Work is mainly expected to be carried out on the <name>@iab.org mailing list,
which is open to any subscriber. The program will also maintain a closed list
for currently active participants, but use of the closed list is expected to be
the exception.

Expected outputs from the program could include:
- Drafting of suggested IAB statements,
- Internet-drafts and/or RFCs that explore the technical aspects of cases where
  resilience could be improved,
- BoFs or IETF area meeting presentations on specific challenges to Internet
  resillience.

The IAB intends to seek community feedback on this program charter in the
coming months (but to get started in the meantime) with the expectation that
the charter may be modified in the timeframe of IETF107/IETF108 based on
feedback received.
